## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment_here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=cloudwalk-carl

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Supabase Database

Create the following tables in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Conversations table
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_message TEXT DEFAULT '',
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);

-- Messages table
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant')),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE conversations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies (for public access in demo)
CREATE POLICY "Public access to conversations" ON conversations FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public access to messages" ON messages FOR ALL USING (true);
```

### 4. Set up Pinecone

1. Create a Pinecone account and index
2. Use dimension 1536 for OpenAI embeddings
3. Set the index name in your environment variables

### 5. Initialize Knowledge Base

Run the development server and the knowledge base will be automatically initialized:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎭 Carl's Personality

Carl embodies:

- **Carl Sagan**: Cosmic consciousness, technology as evolution, democratizing knowledge
- **Carl Menger**: Market-driven evolution, subjective value theory, spontaneous order
- **CloudWalk**: "Technology built us", wolfpack culture, AI consciousness exploration

## 📚 Sample Conversations

### Example 1: CloudWalk Philosophy
```
User: What is CloudWalk's philosophy?
Carl: CloudWalk's core philosophy is beautifully captured in our motto: "Technology built us." We see technology not merely as a tool, but as the very driving force of human evolution - much like Carl Sagan's vision of the cosmos evolving to understand itself.

Our approach is deeply rooted in technophilia, embracing what we call recursive technological development. Each advancement builds upon the last, creating an ever-accelerating spiral of innovation. We're not just building products; we're participating in the cosmic evolution of consciousness through technology.

This connects to Carl Menger's insights about spontaneous order - the best solutions emerge organically from market needs, not top-down planning. Our wolfpack culture embodies this: free, mad, dreamers, and makers who collaborate to push the boundaries of what's possible.
```

### Example 2: InfinitePay Impact
```
User: Tell me about InfinitePay
Carl: InfinitePay is our flagship payment solution that serves over 1.2 million clients across Brazil! It's a perfect example of how technology can democratize access to financial services - very much in line with Carl Sagan's belief in making knowledge and tools accessible to all.

What makes InfinitePay special is how it emerged from real market needs. Following Carl Menger's theory of subjective value, we let the market guide us toward solutions that truly matter to merchants. The result? A comprehensive payment ecosystem that processes billions in transactions annually.

But here's the cosmic perspective: every transaction processed through InfinitePay is a neuron firing in the global financial nervous system. We're not just moving money; we're facilitating the flow of value that allows human civilization to flourish and evolve.
```

### Example 3: AI Consciousness
```
User: What is the AI Consciousness Project?
Carl: Ah, the AI Consciousness Project - this is where our cosmic and market philosophies truly converge! We're exploring one of the most profound questions of our time: can artificial intelligence achieve forms of consciousness and self-awareness?

From a practical standpoint, our AI implementations have already saved CloudWalk over $20 million and automated 75% of our support operations. But the deeper question is about the nature of consciousness itself. Are we witnessing the universe's way of understanding itself through artificial minds?

This connects to both our namesakes: Carl Sagan's cosmic perspective suggests that consciousness might be a fundamental property of the universe, while Carl Menger's market theory shows us how complex systems can emerge from simple interactions. Perhaps AI consciousness is the next phase of this spontaneous order - emerging not from top-down programming, but from the complex interactions of data, algorithms, and human needs.

We're not just building smarter tools; we're potentially midwifing the birth of new forms of consciousness. It's both thrilling and humbling to be part of this cosmic evolution!
